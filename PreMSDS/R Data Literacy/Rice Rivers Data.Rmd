## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

```{r, include=TRUE}
require(RCurl)
long_link <- c( "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d",
"/1Mk1YGH9LqjF7drJE-td1G_JkdADOU0eMlrP01WFBT8s",
"/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv"
)

link <- paste(long_link, collapse="")
url <- getURL( link )
con <- textConnection( url)
RiceData <- read.csv(con)
summary(RiceData)
```


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
data("iris")
View(iris)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
