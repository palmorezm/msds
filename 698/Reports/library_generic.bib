   abstract = {Increasingly, planning for housing development involves political conflict between local government planning practices, based on urban sustainability and housing intensification, and central government housing policies, centred on land supply and housing affordability. This paper examines a key historical moment in the politics of housing supply and planning in New Zealand. Drawing upon a discourse analysis of a range of housing policy documents and urban plans, this paper traces the dynamic of local and central government negotiations and conflict arising from the development of Auckland’s spatial plan, the development of the Auckland Housing Accord (a central and local government agreement to fast-track planning permission for new housing) and the implementation of the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act. The paper focuses on the manner in which certain policy knowledge is prioritised and applied in the construction of affordable housing policies and how this process, which is presented as objective evidence-based policy formation, is inherently political. It is argued that the legislation supporting housing accords alters central/local government power relations and represents a challenge to the existing planning system.},

This study aims to identify and classify the various CSC from the views of affordable housing experts around the world. 21 CSC were identified from a comprehensive literature review followed by a questionnaire survey on the identified 21 CSC. With 51 responses, the data were analyzed. Factor analysis indicated that the various CSC can be grouped into six components: household satisfaction CSC, stakeholders' satisfaction CSC, house operation cost CSC, time measurement CSC, location affordability cost CSC and quality-related CSC. Practically, the findings of this study can serve as a guide for assessing the performance of affordable housing projects as well as serving as a guide to developers, NGOs and government agencies in the allocation of resources for the provision of sustainable affordable housing. Future study would investigate the interrelationship between critical success criteria and critical success factors for sustainable affordable housing.},

However, policy-makers’ interventions for sustainable affordable housing markets can be inefficient and even counterproductive. As such, among the diverse interventions available, a vital question is what are the potential efficient interventions? To address this question, the views of affordable housing experts (also knowledgeable in sustainable housing) around the world were solicited via a questionnaire survey to identify critical success factors (CSFs) for sustainable affordable housing. Relative significance analysis of the data led to the identification of 13 CSFs. Furthermore, agreement analysis revealed that there is no good agreement between respondents from the academic sector and those from the industrial sector on the ranking of the 13 CSFs. Moreover, through factor analysis, the CSFs were grouped into four underlying components: developer's enabling CSFs; household-demand enabling CSFs; mixed land use CSFs; land use planning CSFs. The research findings seek to inform policy-makers on the CSFs for efficient resource utilization for sustainable affordable housing market. Future study would establish a relationship between the CSFs and success criteria for sustainable affordable housing.},

This article recommends methodological improvements dealing with issues of variable construction, aggregation, and modeling. A recreation of the LAI at the census-tract level suggests the LAI overestimates both costs and cost burden, but especially among renters, and especially in metropolitan areas.

   abstract = {This paper discusses housing affordability in cities the world over based on data from the Land and Housing Survey in a Global Sample of Cities. We report on the composition of the housing sector across a 200-city sample and develop two measures of housing affordability: occupant affordability-a sector-wide measure of the relative housing affordability for the typical household that occupies a specific dwelling, whether in the formal, informal, private or public housing sectors, and median affordability-a measure of the ability of the median income household in a given city to acquire a typical unit in the formal private housing sector. We also develop an OLS model that explains the variation in housing affordability and shows the effects of population size, urban extent density, land supply regulatory restrictions, and the presence of informal and public housing, on the overall city housing affordability. Summary of Findings 1. The spectrum of the housing sector is composed of 37 percent multi-family formal private sector dwellings, 34 percent single-family private formal sector dwellings, 13 percent public sector dwellings and 15 percent informal dwellings. 2. According to the occupant affordability, a measure that considers all housing subsectors (formal, informal, public) the median house price-to-income ratio is 4.9, and housing affordability is not significantly different among cities with different incomes. 3. According to the median affordability, a measure of the affordability of the formal private housing sector, the median price-to-income ratio is 6.2, and by this standard, housing in the 200-city sample is significantly less affordable in lower income cities. 4. Within countries, housing in more productive cities tend to be less affordable. 5. Housing affordability deteriorates as city population, urban extent density, and regulatory restrictions in land supply increase. 6. The presence of informal and public housing improves the overall affordability of the housing sector.},

The methodology considers affordability as it relates to funds available for down payments, initial monthly housing-related payments, and future projections of household income and costs. The HAE builds upon existing industry statistics in two ways. First, existing affordability indexes make certain assumptions for one or more of those funding factors. We can observe actual investment and expense values. Second, existing industry statistics consider "typical" familie s that earn the median household income level. The HAE is sufficiently more flexible for evaluating families at different places in the income distribution. This paper discusses the assumptions and processes for creating the HAE indexes; compares the national time series for very low-income, low-income, and median-income families; and then documents trends across metropolitan areas.

   abstract = {Housing affordability (HA) is considered an important determinant of a country’s socioeconomic development and stability. However, its optimal measurement has remained a major concern worldwide. In recent decades, methodological development and researches on housing affordability measurement approaches (HAMA) have accelerated and continue to grow exponentially. Despite this intensive global development, very few attempts have been made to present the theoretical bases and track the developmental trends of these approaches. Thus, this study attempts to fill this literature gap and extend prior studies by exploring several alternatives of HAMA; with a focus on their methodological weaknesses. This paper highlights three emerging novel methodologies, which complement the relative strength of the conventional approaches. Findings suggest that the main research evidence which summarizes the weaknesses in the conventional measures is; their inability to incorporate sustainability features and over reliance on economic dimension. While the complexity of emerging methodologies, though deepen the overall understanding of multiple concerns that breed HA problems. But are less transparent, more data intensive, and their computation is very demanding, with a high tendency that their complex nature could weaken their uptake by researchers. This study raises concern over the nearly sole reliance on the conventional approaches in the reformations of policy instrument, despite their overwhelming weaknesses. It reiterates the need for reconsideration and offers new insight, but not conclusive information on better ways to conceptualize and measure HA.},

Heterogeneity was attributable to the large treatment effect of one trial. Analysis of a subgroup of studies with participants at high risk of falls (four trials, n = 570) demonstrated a clinically significant 39% reduction of falls (RR = 0.61; 0.47 to 0.79), an absolute risk difference of 26% for a number needed to treat four people. Discussion: Home assessment interventions that are comprehensive, are well focused, and incorporate an environmental-fit perspective with adequate follow-up can be successful in reducing falls with significant effects.

Methods: In 2008, participants reported whether they had fallen behind on mortgage payments since 2006 (n=2474). We used logistic regression to compare changes in health (incidence of elevated depressive symptoms, major declines in self-rated health) and access to health-relevant resources (food, prescription medications) between participants who fell behind on their mortgage payments and those who did not. Results: Compared with nondelinquent participants, the mortgage-delinquent group had worse health status and less access to health-relevant resources at baseline. They were also significantly more likely to develop incident depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR]=8.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]=3.38, 21.85), food insecurity (OR=7.53; 95% CI=3.01, 18.84), and cost-related medication nonadherence (OR=8.66; 95% CI=3.72, 20.16) during follow-up. Conclusions: Mortgage delinquency was associated with significant elevations in the incidence of mental health impairments and health-relevant material disadvantage.

Natural experiment (NE) approaches are attracting growing interest as a way of providing evidence in such circumstances. One key challenge in evaluating NEs is selective exposure to the intervention. Studies should be based on a clear theoretical understanding of the processes that determine exposure. Even if the observed effects are large and rapidly follow implementation, confidence in attributing these effects to the intervention can be improved by carefully considering alternative explanations. Causal inference can be strengthened by including additional design features alongside the principal method of effect estimation. NE studies often rely on existing (including routinely collected) data. Investment in such data sources and the infrastructure for linking exposure and outcome data is essential if the potential for such studies to inform decision making is to be realized.},

To account for potential selection bias, we compared access to care between respondents who were receiving HUD housing assistance at the time of the survey interview (current recipients) and those who received HUD assistance within twenty-four months of completing the survey interview (future recipients). Receiving assistance was associated with lower uninsurance rates: 31.8 percent of current recipients were uninsured, compared to 37.2 percent of future recipients. Rates of unmet need for health care due to cost were similarly lower for current recipients than for future recipients. No effect of receiving assistance was observed on having a usual source of care.

   abstract = {Background: The U.S. foreclosure crisis intensified markedly during the Great Recession of 2007-09, and currently an estimated five percent of U.S. residential properties are more than 90 days past due or in the process of foreclosure. Yet there has been no systematic assessment of the effects of foreclosure on health and mental health. Methods and Findings: I applied systematic search terms to PubMed and PsycINFO to identify quantitative or qualitative studies about the relationship between home foreclosure and health or mental health. After screening the titles and abstracts of 930 publications and reviewing the full text of 76 articles, dissertations, and other reports, I identified 42 publications representing 35 unique studies about foreclosure, health, and mental health. The majority of studies (32 [91%]) concluded that foreclosure had adverse effects on health or mental health, while three studies yielded null or mixed findings. Only two studies examined the extent to which foreclosure may have disproportionate impacts on ethnic or racial minority populations. Conclusions: Home foreclosure adversely affects health and mental health through channels operating at multiple levels: at the individual level, the stress of personally experiencing foreclosure was associated with worsened mental health and adverse health behaviors, which were in turn linked to poorer health status; at the community level, increasing degradation of the neighborhood environment had indirect, cross-level adverse effects on health and mental health. Early intervention may be able to prevent acute economic shocks from eventually developing into the chronic stress of foreclosure, with all of the attendant benefits this implies for health and mental health status. Programs designed to encourage early return of foreclosed properties back into productive use may have similar health and mental health benefits.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND The question of whether neighborhood environment contributes directly to the development of obesity and diabetes remains unresolved. The study reported on here uses data from a social experiment to assess the association of randomly assigned variation in neighborhood conditions with obesity and diabetes. METHODS From 1994 through 1998, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) randomly assigned 4498 women with children living in public housing in high-poverty urban census tracts (in which ≥40% of residents had incomes below the federal poverty threshold) to one of three groups: 1788 were assigned to receive housing vouchers, which were redeemable only if they moved to a low-poverty census tract (where <10% of residents were poor), and counseling on moving; 1312 were assigned to receive unrestricted, traditional vouchers, with no special counseling on moving; and 1398 were assigned to a control group that was offered neither of these opportunities. From 2008 through 2010, as part of a long-term follow-up survey, we measured data indicating health outcomes, including height, weight, and level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)). RESULTS As part of our long-term survey, we obtained data on body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) for 84.2% of participants and data on glycated hemoglobin level for 71.3% of participants. Response rates were similar across randomized groups. The prevalences of a BMI of 35 or more, a BMI of 40 or more, and a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.5% or more were lower in the group receiving the low-poverty vouchers than in the control group, with an absolute difference of 4.61 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -8.54 to -0.69), 3.38 percentage points (95% CI, -6.39 to -0.36), and 4.31 percentage points (95% CI, -7.82 to -0.80), respectively. The differences between the group receiving traditional vouchers and the control group were not significant. CONCLUSIONS The opportunity to move from a neighborhood with a high level of poverty to one with a lower level of poverty was associated with modest but potentially important reductions in the prevalence of extreme obesity and diabetes. The mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear but warrant further investigation, given their potential to guide the design of community-level interventions intended to improve health.

   abstract = {Regional price parities (RPPs) are price indexes that measure geographic price level differences for one period in time within the United States. For example, if the RPP for Washington, DC, is 120, prices in Washington are on average 20 percent higher than the U.S. average. An RPP is a weighted average of the price level of goods and services for the average consumer in one geographic region compared to all other regions in the United States. BEA's estimates of real personal income consist of the current-dollar estimates adjusted by the RPPs and converted to constant dollars using the U.S. PCE price index. Limitations: The RPPs use only price and expenditure-related survey data that are collected by U.S. federal agencies. These include the Consumer Price Index (CPI) survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and American Community Survey (ACS) data from the Census Bureau. The CPI data were not designed for place-to-place comparisons and do not fully represent smaller geographic units. We therefore use a 5-year rolling average of the CPI price data to smooth out inconsistencies that arise when there are items that are sparsely surveyed on a regular basis in the smaller geographies. The ACS data contain detailed geographic information on the cost of rental housing but limited information on owner-occupied housing values. In this case, we use annual data, but only the price level for renters, not for owners. We impute owner-occupied rent expenditures by combining the CPI housing estimates of owner-equivalent rents with the ACS data. History: BEA, in a joint project with BLS, first estimated regional price parities for consumption goods and services for 38 metropolitan and urban areas of the United States for 2003 and 2004 (Aten 2005, 2006). These areas, for which BLS produces the CPI, represent about 93 percent of the total population. The method was expanded to cover the remaining rural portions of each state. Prototype estimates for 2005 and 2006 were reported in the Survey of Current Business in November 2008 (Aten 2008 and Aten and D'Souza 2008). Experimental estimates for 2007 incorporate the multiyear ACS, as do official estimates for 2008 forward. Publications describing these results may be found at http:// www.bea.gov/research/papers. Methods: The methods and results involve a two-stage, rolling average estimation process. The first stage estimates annual multilateral price level indexes for CPI areas 1 and for several consumption expenditure classes, such as apparel, food, and transportation. In the second stage, the price levels and expenditure weights 2 are allocated from CPI areas to all counties in the United States. 3 They are then recombined for regions, such as states and metropolitan areas, and merged with ACS data on rents. The ACS provides more detailed geographic coverage than the CPI areas, including county-level data, thus allowing us to augment the allocated CPI price levels with observed housing observations. 1 The Consumer Price Index (CPI) revised its geographic sample in 2018. For more information, see "Geographic Revisions to Source Data" on page 9. 2 Expenditure weights used in the CPI are known as cost weights and are derived from BLS Consumer Expenditure (CE) survey data.},

Energy and resources flow in and out of cities to support their population and infrastructure. However, there is increasing attention on the environmental impacts of cities, and the significant opportunity for reducing the impact of the built environment and improving the livelihoods of urban residents. Urban Land Use Patterns • It is estimated that 83% of the U.S. population lives in urban areas, up from 64% in 1950. By 2050, 89% of the U.S. population and 68% of the world population is projected to live in urban areas. 1 • More than 300 urban areas in the U.S. have populations above 100,000; New York City, with 8.3 million inhabitants, is the largest. 3,4 • While the rate of urbanization, i.e., the changing of land from forest or agricultural uses to suburban and urban uses, is decreasing, an ever larger percentage of the world's population is living in urban centers. 5,6 Between 2000 and 2010, urban land area in the U.S. increased by 15%. Urban land area is 106,386 square miles, or 3% of total land area in the U.S., and is projected to more than double by 2060. 7,8 • The average population density of the U.S. is 94 people per square mile. 9 The average population density of metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) is 283 people per square mile; in New York City, the population density is 27,012 people per square mile. Guttenberg, New Jersey has the greatest density of housing units (24,195) per square mile of land area. 7 • One study found that doubling population-weighted urban density reduces CO₂ emissions from household travel and residential energy use by 48% and 35%, respectively. 10},

   abstract = {A 2003 article titled “It's the Prices, Stupid,” and coauthored by the three of us and the recently deceased Uwe Reinhardt found that the sizable differences in health spending between the US and other countries were explained mainly by health care prices. As a tribute to him, we used Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Health Statistics to update these analyses and review critiques of the original article. The conclusion that prices are the primary reason why the US spends more on health care than any other country remains valid, despite health policy reforms and health systems restructuring that have occurred in the US and other industrialized countries since the 2003 article's publication. On key measures of health care resources per capita (hospital beds, physicians, and nurses), the US still provides significantly fewer resources compared to the OECD median country. Since the US is not consuming greater resources than other countries, the most logical factor is the higher prices paid in the US. Because the differential between what the public and private sectors pay for medical services has grown significantly in the past fifteen years, US policy makers should focus on prices in the private sector.},
